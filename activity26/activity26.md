This project defines a structure for representing a point in space 
with x and y coordinates. It also overloads the equality operator (==) 
to compare points.

Structure

Point: A structure with two members:
short x: The x-coordinate.
short y: The y-coordinate.
Functionality

Users can input x and y coordinates.
The program checks if the coordinates are equal and provides feedback.
Usage

Compile the program.
Run the executable.
Enter the x and y coordinates when prompted.
See if the coordinates are equal.
Example

Input: 3 (for x) and 3 (for y)
Output: "These 2 coordinates are equal to each other!"
Input: 3 (for x) and 4 (for y)
Output: "These 2 coordinates are not equal to each other."
Conclusion

This project provides a simple way to represent points and 
demonstrates operator overloading in C++.
