README FOR NAME SUBSTRING CODE

Overview:
This C++ program extracts and displays the first and last names from
a full name string.


Code Explanation:

Input: 
The full name is defined as a string (e.g., "Merary Murillo").


Substring Extraction:
- firstName is extracted using substr(0, 6).
- lastName is extracted using substr(6, 12).
- The "substr"" method creates a subset of the original string by
specifying a starting index and a length.

Output: 
The program prints the first and last names.
