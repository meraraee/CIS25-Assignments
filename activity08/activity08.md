Overview:
This code demonstrates a simple C++ program that performs division between a double and an integer, highlighting how type conversion affects the result. It initializes a double and an integer, divides them, and prints the result.

Code Explanation:
- The program starts by including the <iostream> header for input and output operations and uses the std namespace to avoid prefixing standard library components
- The main function is defined as main08(). Inside this function:
- A double variable x is initialized with a value of 10.
- An integer variable y is initialized with a value of 3.
- The program performs division of x by y, storing the result in another double variable z.
- Finally, the program outputs the result using cout.
