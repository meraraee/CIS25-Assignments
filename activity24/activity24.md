CUTOMER STRUCTURE

Description: 
This C++ program demonstrates the use of a struct to represent a 
person, allowing for the storage and retrieval of their name and age. 
It showcases how to create a custom data type and use it to manage 
related data efficiently.

Features:
- Defines a Person struct to hold a person's name and age.
- Prompts the user for input to populate the struct's members.
- Outputs the user's name and age.


Struct Definition:
The Person struct serves as a blueprint for creating person objects. 

It includes the following members:
name: A string to store the person's name.
age: An integer to store the person's age.


How It Works...

- The program starts by defining the Person struct with its attributes.
- In the main function, an instance of Person is created.
- The user is prompted to enter their name and age, which are then 
stored in the corresponding struct members.
- Finally, the program outputs the name and age entered by the user.
