#Array Sorting Program

Description:

This program demonstrates how to sort an array of integers using a 
simple swap function. The swap function takes two integer pointers 
and swaps their values. The main function initializes an array, 
displays the original array, performs a swap operation, and then 
displays the swapped array.


How the Code Works...

Include Libraries:
- #include <iostream>: Enables input and output operations using cin and cout.

Function Definition:
- swap: This function takes two integer pointers as parameters. It swaps the values of the integers that the pointers point to using a temporary variable.

- Main Function:
* An integer array arr is initialized with two elements.
* The indices of the elements to be swapped are stored in element0 and
element1.
* The original array is printed to the console.
* he swap function is called with the addresses of the elements to be swapped.
* Finally, the program prints the array after the swap operation.
