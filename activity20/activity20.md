Overview:
This program takes a user-defined number of integers, stores them in 
an array, and calculates the sum of these integers.

##Features:
- Prompts the user to input the number of integers they wish to enter.
- Collects the integers from the user.
- Computes and displays the sum of the entered integers.

##Code Structure:
- Function total(int arr1[], int sizee):
- Takes an array of integers and its size as parameters.
- Calculates the sum of the integers in the array.
- Prints the sum to the console.
- Returns the sum.

##Function main():
- Asks the user for the number of integers they want to enter.
- Initializes an array to hold the integers.
- Collects the integers from the user using a loop.
- Calls the total function to compute the sum.
