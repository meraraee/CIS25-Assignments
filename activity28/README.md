REUSABLE FUNCTION: Double To String 
    
This project provides a reusable function to convert a double value 
into a string format with a fixed-point representation, preventing the 
use of scientific notation. The function also allows setting a 
precision for the number of decimal places.


Files Included:

main.cpp: The main program that demonstrates the usage of the reusable 
function.

activity28.hpp: Header file that declares the doubleToString function.

reusableFunction.cpp: Contains the definition of the reusable
doubleToString function.

Functionality:

The doubleToString function takes a double value and converts it to a 
string, formatted with a fixed-point representation (i.e., no 
scientific notation). It also ensures that you can specify the number 
of decimal places in the result.
