Overview:
This program demonstrates how to use the sizeof() operator in C++ to find the size, in bytes, of different data types, specifically short and double. It also retrieves the limits for these data types.

Prompt:
Find the size and limits of short and double data types on your machine.

Key Features:
- Outputs the size of the short data type.
- Outputs the size of the double data type.
- Displays the minimum and maximum values for both short and double.
- Illustrates that you donâ€™t need to declare variables to use sizeof().
  
Code Explanation:
* Including Libraries: The program includes <iostream> for input and output, and <limits> for accessing numeric limits.
* Main Function: The main() function serves as the entry point of the program.

Using sizeof():
- The program uses the sizeof() operator to determine the size of the short and double data types.
- It outputs the results to the console.
