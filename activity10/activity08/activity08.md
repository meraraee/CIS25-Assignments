#Description

This program demonstrates how to modify integer division to yield a double result in C++. By initializing at least one of the operands as a double, we ensure that the division is performed with floating-point precision.

#Features

- Demonstrates the concept of type casting and precision in arithmetic operations.
- Outputs the result of the division as a double.

#Requirements

A C++ compiler (such as g++, clang++, or an integrated development environment like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio).

#Installation

Clone the repository or download the code file.
Open the file in your preferred C++ development environment.

#Usage

- Compile the program using your C++ compiler.
- Run the executable.
- The program will output the result of the division as a double.
